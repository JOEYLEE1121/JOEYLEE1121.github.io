## About

![Landing]({{site.url}}/images/2023-03-22-VIZTA3/Landing.png)

The objective of this project is to develop a university course reviewing system that provides students with an intuitive and informative way to assess potential courses of interest. The system focuses on visualizing static data, such as grading criteria and distribution of reviews by year and professor, to enable students to make more informed decisions about their academic choices.

VIZTA offers a comprehensive and user-friendly interface that allows students to easily search for courses and view relevant information, including course descriptions, prerequisites, and professor bios. In addition, students can view course ratings and read detailed reviews from other students to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the course content and teaching staff.

VIZTA utilizes data visualization techniques to present review data in a meaningful way, enabling students to easily identify trends and make more informed decisions. For example, students can view the distribution of reviews over time to assess the consistency of a course's quality, or view review data by professor to identify instructors who are particularly effective.

VIZTA also provides a mechanism for students to leave reviews of their own, allowing them to share their experiences with other students and contribute to the broader community of learners. Overall, the system aims to provide a comprehensive and informative way for students to review courses and make informed academic decisions.

## Development Process

**Step 1 - Meeting Notes: Hold a meeting and decide what feature to develop or to fix.**

![Notion]({{site.url}}/images/2023-03-22-VIZTA3/Notion.png)

**Step 2 - Github-issue: Create an issue based on the meeting notes.**

![github-issue]({{site.url}}/images/2023-03-22-VIZTA3/github-issue.png)

**Step 3 - Github-branch: Create a github branch corresponding to the issue.**

![github-branch]({{site.url}}/images/2023-03-22-VIZTA3/github-branch.png)

**Step 4 - Github-commit: Push commits based on the commit template.**

## Publishment

Due to the limitations of our current server plan on Render, we have noticed that its performance has been slower than what we require. To address this issue, we have decided to migrate our server to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to take advantage of its powerful infrastructure and scalable resources.

By transitioning to AWS, we will have access to a wider range of server options that can better accommodate our growing needs. With the ability to customize our server configurations and add more computing power as required, we can ensure that our applications and services are running at optimal speeds, even during peak usage periods.

Furthermore, AWS offers a range of management and monitoring tools that can help us identify and troubleshoot any performance issues in real-time, allowing us to provide a seamless user experience. With this move, we are confident that we can provide our customers with the reliable and responsive services they deserve.

## Potential Improvements

1. **Constant UI revamp**

   Having a professional designer on a development team is essential for ensuring that the product is visually appealing, user-friendly, and meets industry standards. Unfortunately, our team did not have a dedicated designer, which resulted in the development process becoming inefficient. We had to go through a total of three UI revamps before the final product was ready for release. These changes were time-consuming and disrupted the development process, as we had to go back and make revisions to the code each time a new design was introduced.


   First version draft:

   Second version draft:

   Final Version:
    ![FinalVersion]({{site.url}}/images/2023-03-22-VIZTA3/FinalVersion.png)


   Our team recognizes the value of having a dedicated designer on the team. We will prioritize finding a designer for future projects, or alternatively, outsourcing design work to professionals. Additionally, we will continue to emphasize the importance of creating strong drafts and prototypes before moving forward with development. By doing so, we can ensure that the final product meets our standards and is a success with our users.

2. **Git commits & Sprint Management**
   
   Our team understands the importance of following best practices for software development to ensure code quality and maintainability. As part of this, we adopted a structured approach to Git commits using a template, which helped to standardize the format and make it easier to review changes. We also utilized Jira for sprint management, which enabled us to plan and execute our work in a more Agile manner. Finally, we used Notion to keep track of meeting notes and other project-related information.

   Despite the benefits of these practices, we found that it became increasingly challenging to keep up with them as our project progressed. This was largely due to time constraints, as we had to balance multiple responsibilities and competing priorities. While we tried our best to maintain these practices, we occasionally had to cut corners in order to meet deadlines or complete other critical tasks. As a result, we may have missed opportunities to optimize our workflow and ensure that our code was as high-quality as possible.
   
3. **Insufficient Refactor and Peer Review**

   Refactoring is an essential part of software development, as it helps to ensure that code is easy to read, understand, and maintain over time. However, when faced with multiple responsibilities, it can be easy to overlook this crucial step. In my case, I had to balance school coursework with our project, and as a result, I did not allocate enough time to properly refactor my code. This meant that there were likely areas of the codebase that could have been improved, but which were left unaddressed.

   In addition to impacting the quality of the code, inadequate refactoring can also make it difficult for new team members to understand the codebase. When a new frontend team member joined our project, they encountered difficulties in navigating the code and understanding its structure. This could have been avoided if we had dedicated more time to refactoring and ensuring that our code was as easy to understand as possible.

   To avoid these issues in the future, our team will need to prioritize refactoring and peer review as essential parts of our workflow. We will need to allocate sufficient time to these activities, even when faced with competing priorities, in order to ensure that our code is as high-quality as possible. Additionally, we will need to communicate the importance of these activities to new team members and ensure that they are integrated into our onboarding process.
