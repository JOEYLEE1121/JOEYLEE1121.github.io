# CMM: Probablistic Approach on Price Movements Using Famous Indicators



## About

### Introduction

Our objective was to discover the optimal trading points through the interpretation of highly favored indicators. Our approach involved an interactive utilization of backtesting results from various indicators and their combinations. The algorithm was fine-tuned through backtesting to deploy the most advantageous combination of indicators, strategies, and respective parameters in response to various market scenarios. Testing encompassed six renowned indicators: Order Block, Candle Patterns, RSI, Divergence, Fibonacci Retracement, and CME Gap. Nonetheless, the selection of indicators remained fluid and was contingent upon their performance alongside other strategies during backtesting.

### Trading Idea Description

- Within the adequate timeframe, the algorithm will check whether the following indicators are confirmed or not.

- From the previous backtest result of all the combination, we define the weight for each trade to make (the higher the win-rate in backtesting, the more likely the algorithm will profit in the real market)

- The algorithm will trade with higher leverage within conditions that meet win-rate over 70 percent, medium for win-rate between 70~50, and not trade under 50 percent. (leveraging formula to be uploaded in trading logic section)

### Trading Logic

Each strategy has its own unique target profit and stop loss, and the amalgamation of these methods may bring about conflicts. In response to this, we have devised a plan to tackle such a situation by handpicking the most optimal conditions for each combination of strategy under the following categorized situations:

1. The highest win-rate and an adequate number of trades were achieved during the backtest, with the lowest stop loss and the highest target profit among strategies.
2. The highest win-rate and an adequate number of trades were achieved during the backtest, with the highest stop loss and the lowest target profit among strategies.
3. The highest win-rate and an adequate number of trades were achieved during the backtest, with an absolute value for both target profit and stop loss (for instance, a simple 10 percent profit and 5 percent loss).

With an awe-inspiring backtest result of over 53,000% ROI, the CMM strategy has proved to be a formidable force in the world of trading. This method has consistently delivered profitable returns, with the sole exception of February 2018. Such data highlights the remarkable efficacy of the CMM strategy, substantiating its potential to be a valuable asset in any trading portfolio.

## Challenges

The live testing results failed to meet our expectations, as it was revealed that our model had overfitted the backtesting data for the years 2018 to 2020. This unfortunate occurrence created a bias that rendered our approach effective only during those specific years. The world of trading is one that is in a constant state of flux, and as such, improvement necessitates the deployment of an algorithm that is nimble enough to adapt quickly to shifts in trends.
