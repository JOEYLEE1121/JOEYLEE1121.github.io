| **Any trading philosophy/hypothesis behind your strategy?**<br /><br />The CMM algorithm is designed for technical analysis only, and it follows a "buy the dip" strategy to prepare for long positions during bear markets. This strategy assumes that the market will not suddenly go to zero and will eventually recover to some extent, and that the market has enough trading volume to avoid being impacted by the algorithm's actions.<br /><br />**What kind of data/ inputs your strategy use?**<br /><br />The algorithm relies primarily on Bollinger bands with a 20-period moving average and 2 standard deviations. It targets sudden market plummets and performs buy and sell actions after sufficient recovery. The algorithm also has a risk management strategy in place for situations where the market fails to reach its target price. |

| **What is the exact trading logics?**<br /><br />The algorithm is designed to purchase commodities when the 1-hour candle falls below the lower band of the Bollinger Band. Rather than buying immediately when the candle touches the lower Bollinger Band, the algorithm waits until the variable e exceeds the optimal e obtained from back-testing. Variable e is calculated by multiplying variable x, the percentage drop of a candle within the hourly candle from the lower Bollinger band, by variable y, the degree in radians the candle meets the lower Bollinger Band.<br /><br />**What conditions will trigger trades?**<br /><br />For instance, if the algorithm determines the optimal constant as 5% percentage drop of a candle from the lower Bollinger Band multiplied by the degree of Ï€/2 (approximately 1.65), any hourly candles that yield an e value greater or equal to 1.65 will prompt the algorithm to take a long position immediately. After the long position is triggered, the algorithm sells under the following three circumstances:<br /><br /><u>Best Case:</u> The algorithm sells at the moving average when the current hourly candle (the candle the algorithm purchased) closes above the lower Bollinger Band and the following candles hit the moving average before touching the lower Bollinger Band.<br /><br /><u>Average Case:</u> The algorithm sells when the following candles reach the lower Bollinger Band after the current candle closes below it.<br /><br /><u>Worst Case:</u>If the candle fails to touch the lower Bollinger Band and experiences a significant drop, the algorithm triggers a risk management algorithm. When the drop exceeds the variable k (to be explained in the next section), the algorithm initiates the risk management strategy.<br /><br />**How do you derive the trading model/ logic? What theories/ methodologies you applied? Any assumptions made?**<br /><br />The calculation of variables e and k is based on the hypothesis that "the market will try to retrieve its original price to some point after a sudden plummet." The variables are computed by multiplying factors that are believed to be influential on the hypothesis. Two factors are considered when computing variable e: first, the percentage drop, which is an influential factor due to the market's elastic nature; and second, the degree between the candle and lower Bollinger Band, which represents the deviation of current price from the short-term trend. For the calculation of variable k, the back-testing method is used to determine the best returning constant: at what percentage drop will the algorithm purchase additional commodities to lower the average price and exit the market with fewer or no losses. The basic logic of variable k is also based on the hypothesis that the market will retrieve to its original price after a sudden plummet. The risk management strategy is explained in more detail in the next section. |
