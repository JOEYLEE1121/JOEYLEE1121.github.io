## About

![intro]({{site.url}}/images/2023-03-01-VIZTA2/intro.png)

The objective of this project is to develop a university course reviewing system that provides students with an intuitive and informative way to assess potential courses of interest. The system focuses on visualizing static data, such as grading criteria and distribution of reviews by year and professor, to enable students to make more informed decisions about their academic choices.

VIZTA offers a comprehensive and user-friendly interface that allows students to easily search for courses and view relevant information, including course descriptions, prerequisites, and professor bios. In addition, students can view course ratings and read detailed reviews from other students to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the course content and teaching staff.

VIZTA utilizes data visualization techniques to present review data in a meaningful way, enabling students to easily identify trends and make more informed decisions. For example, students can view the distribution of reviews over time to assess the consistency of a course's quality, or view review data by professor to identify instructors who are particularly effective.

VIZTA also provides a mechanism for students to leave reviews of their own, allowing them to share their experiences with other students and contribute to the broader community of learners. Overall, the system aims to provide a comprehensive and informative way for students to review courses and make informed academic decisions.
