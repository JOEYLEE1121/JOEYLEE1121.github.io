# Using Google Map API for IOS Application

## About

A basic project for iOS was completed to connect with the Google Maps API. The project aimed to integrate external APIs into iOS applications. The first step was researching the Google Maps API documentation to understand the required parameters and API endpoints. Subsequently, Xcode was used to create a basic iOS application with a map view, and the necessary code was added to establish a connection to the Google Maps API and retrieve the map data.

Customization of the map view was done to display the necessary information such as markers, zoom levels, and location data. User interaction was incorporated to allow users to search for specific locations and interact with the map view.

In summary, this project provided an excellent foundation for working with APIs in iOS development, offering practical experience in connecting to an external service and integrating that data into the application. Future projects will continue to explore the possibilities of integrating APIs into iOS applications.
